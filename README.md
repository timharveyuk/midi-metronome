Master clock to synchronise drummer with midi capable instruments

This is an Arduino project for a master clock which outputs both click audio and midi beat signals to drive an 
external synthesizer. I have a Nord Stage 2 synthesizer which has various rhythmic effects and an arpeggiator 
which are very difficult to synchronise with a drummer in a live gig.
